# Spread!
## A tool for the organization of viral events, through the use of exponential growth.

### Description

Spread is a mobile application built to _React Native_, integrated with _Firebase Firestore_ and _SMS API_. Users can create events, for which every invitee will be able to invite a finite amount of people. The fact that the invites are being sent individually (thus limited access is granted) increases attendance rate and adds an air of exclusivity to the event.
